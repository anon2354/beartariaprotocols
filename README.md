THIS FOR EASY PUBLIC VIEWING. PERIODIC UPDATES WILL BE POSTED. THE ACTUAL FILES ARE BEING EDITED BY THE CONTRIBUTORS.
PLEASE, IF YOU HAVE IDEAS, PUT THEM IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION SECTION AT THE BOTTOM.

INTENT
Before continuing please listen to the stream #1010 on t.me/wdtlpodcast. For those who missed it, we are attempting to build a Christian alternative to Sharia 
law. Beartaria is a Christian nation and it is good that a nation be governed justly. Therefore we are in need of a body of principles, rules and precepts (which
we call protocols) in order to govern the functioning of our society. The intent of this document is not to supplant or replace biblical law, we are instead 
trying to codify it. The completed text should clearly and consisely lay out the protocols necessary for building an orderly, just, Godly and biblically based 
system of government.

The protocols are not intended to bind the reader to any particular system of government (democracy, monarchy, etc). It's function is more basic than that. When 
they are finished the protocols will be the gold standard of the Christian tradition. With them any Christian (whether they be a citizen, low official, or a 
Supreme Emperor) can examine the particular political and judicial system he lives in and judge to what extent it adheres to the principles laid down in the 
Bible. This is no small undertaking. However, we have the benefit of a completed biblical text, and many centuries of commentaries regarding Christian ethics and 
law. This means that one of our priorities ought to be gathering and absorbing all the best of the previous work done on this topic. 

God's blessings on all those who take up this challenge. We pray that this project would be helpful in crystalizing what it means to live in loving relationship 
with our Heavenly Father.

RULES FOR CONTRIBUTORS
This project is biblically based. Our ultimate authority for the protocols will be the Holy Bible.

All protocols must reference at least one bible text which explicitly underpins either the actual intent of the protocol or the principle on which the protocol
is based.

Protocols may reference biblical commentaries which are published earlier than 1900AD. However, commentaries may only be used to provide context. Protocols may 
not be based solely on texts other than the bible.

When interpreting biblical texts keep the following principles in mind:
    
Read the biblical text as you would to a 12 year old child. The meaning you glean should be clear and evident to the childlike mind. Theorizing about what a text
may symbolize has no place here. This is law we are writing. Remember that people's lives and livelyhoods will hang in the balance.
The truth of scripture is fractal. It can be seen on the micro and the macro.

References should be done inline using the following styles
Bible Texts: (John 3:16)
We will use the English Standard Version (please no bible lawyers; if you want to reference Strongs definitions go ahead)
Commentaries (Thomas Aquinas, SUMMA THEOLOGICA; pg 56)

All the best and Godspeed!
